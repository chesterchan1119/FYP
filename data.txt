Requirement: 

Objective: 
The application aims to provide a comprehensive Gymnastic Personal Training experience. 

Details: 
Instant 1-on-1 conversation: Client can seek gymnastic advices to Virtual Trainer and have the response instantly via voice and sound display. 

3D Video Processing: Real-time Visual input can also be transmitted to the virtual trainer through the camera. And it would give accuracy for the gymnastic position’s correctness (e.g. Bench Press) 

User data Tracking: a dedicated page designed to capture and store your valuable user data, providing a comprehensive overview towards achieving users’ fitness goals, data including workout duration, skill progression, sets and reps, body measurements, and personal bests.


Division of labor: 
Member 1's work:    3D Modeling of AR Character, Frontend
Member 2's work:    Fine tuning GPT model, implementation voice conversation
Member 3's work:    CVPR on Image/Video, processing and generate suggestion on posture



Proposed Solution:
Frontend: React Native
Backend:  Python Flask
Deep Learning Model:  Alphapose, scikit-learn
Database:   MongoDB
3D model for virtual trainer character:   Blender, ThreeJS
Deployment:    AWS Cloud
Validation / Testing:    Postman, Appium
